# My CUDA Toolkit

This CMake-based project contains some wrappers around the CUDA functions I use frequently. 
The wrappers are mainly concerned with throwing an exception with **meaningful** error messages in case of errors or **ensuring** that the GPU is always shut down properly.
If necessary, this library will be expanded by me.
